## Overview

AirServer converts any Mac into professional-grade wireless display receiver accepting connections from virtually any mobile device regardless of platform. Where native AirPlay mirroring limits Mac reception to specific scenarios, AirServer opens universal mirroring supporting iOS, Android, Chrome OS, and Windows devices through their respective wireless display protocols.

AirPlay compatibility receives screen mirroring and audio streaming from iPhones, iPads, and other Apple devices with the reliability and quality Apple's protocol provides. The AirPlay implementation matches Apple TV reception capabilities, making Macs viable alternatives to dedicated receivers in presentation and home entertainment scenarios.

Google Cast support accepts connections from Android devices and Chrome browsers, extending mirroring beyond Apple's ecosystem into the broader device landscape. Android users can share screens without requiring Apple hardware, while Chromebook users gain presentation capabilities matching those available on dedicated Chromecast hardware.

Miracast reception enables Windows device mirroring through Microsoft's wireless display standard. The Miracast support addresses enterprise environments where Windows devices predominate but Mac hardware serves presentation displays. Cross-platform capability eliminates protocol-based compatibility concerns.

Multiple simultaneous connections display several mirrored screens on single Mac display, valuable for collaboration scenarios comparing content from different sources. The multi-connection capability transforms meetings where multiple participants share content without connection switching delays.

Recording functionality captures mirrored content for later review, training material creation, or documentation purposes. The recording addresses scenarios where mirrored presentations should be preserved without requiring separate capture software.

Quality optimization adjusts mirroring resolution and performance based on network conditions and content type. High-motion content like video prioritizes frame rate while static presentations maximize resolution. The automatic optimization ensures appropriate quality without manual configuration.

Retina resolution support displays mirrored content at full quality on high-resolution Mac displays. The Retina handling ensures mirrored content appears as sharply as native content rather than suffering upscaling artifacts.
